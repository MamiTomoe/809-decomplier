# Akko-809-Decompiler
Welcome to my own verison of native decompiler!
My decompiler is based off a imaginery compiler that based off 
gcc syntax c 90 without optimiton.

Decompiler is a translator from compiled lanuage to it ancient  version( before
complition).
There are two typs: one is a high level decompiler(from it's bytecode to the
lanague it was wriiten to) and the second native(from assembly to puesdo c).

My decompiler is a native one and It has a few features:
*  Regonzining  from 8 until 64 architctures.
*  Regonzing if
*  Regonizing symbols
*  Regonizing functions
*  Regonizing vars
*  Regonizing one opcode
*  Regonizing whiles
*  Knows to read from files
*  Has types regonzition.
*  Can translate basic (all the matmetic artmetic and a little bit complicated stuff)

How to use?
Give it an assembly/text file and see the output.

Enjoy , Yuval Elbar :).
